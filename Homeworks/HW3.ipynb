    "In this homework, you will start to practice the material from Weeks 1-5. Refer back to the readings from this week for support! For this assignment you will investigate a research question using a dataset of your choice. It can be from the census for a particular place, one of the open data portals we explored in Week 4, or from one of the data sources Jo Klein presented through the library. The requirements on the data are: \n",
    "* Must be sufficiently large (>5,000 data points)\n",
    "* Must have at least 4 variables of interest (so, at least 4 different columns)\n",
    "* Must have a spatial component (so, at least one additional column defines the geometry, or two if lat/lon)\n",
    "* Must be from a reputable source (you can trace the origins of the data)\n",
